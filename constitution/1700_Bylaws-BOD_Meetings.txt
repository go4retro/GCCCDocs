BOARD OF DIRECTORS Meetings

   General

     Meetings shall be held on an as-needed basis, but must be held at least
     quarterly. Meetings time and place are designated by the President.

     No actions shall be taken by the Board of Directors unless a quorum is
     assembled.

     Board of Directors meetings shall be held informally, and need not
     follow strict parliamentary procedure.

     All meetings shall have minutes taken and passed to the Secretary, as
     specified in Article IX, Section 1.

     Only Board of Directors members may attend Board of Directors meetings,
     except as specified in the Bylaws, or by invitation of any Board of
     Directors member.

   Special Board of Directors Meetings

     If the President deems immediate action necessary, a Special Board of
     Directors meeting may be called. If it is possible to resolve the issue
     at a regular Board of Directors meeting, a Special Board of Directors
     meeting is inappropriate.

     A Special Board of Directors Meeting may be conducted using:

       Telephone conference call; Electronic conference

       Decisions made at Special Board of Directors meetings are subject to
       review at following regular Board of Directors meetings.

       Minutes are not necessary, but a record of decisions made must be kept.

   Voting

     A motion is decided by majority vote of Board of Directors members. All
     Board of Directors members get one vote.

     The President may cast a tie-breaking vote when necessary.

     If the President is not present and there is a tie, the Vice President
     may cast a tie-breaking vote.

     Board of Directors members not present may have their vote cast by proxy.
