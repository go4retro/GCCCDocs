Membership suspension and cancellation

   A member whose membership is cancelled cannot again become a member of the
   GCCC, and may not attend any GCCC functions.

   A member whose membership is suspended is still a member of the GCCC, but
   for a period of time as determined by the Board of Directors may not attend
   any GCCC functions.

   Any member who is suspended by the Board of Directors as a disciplinary
   action is deemed to be not in good standing. However, such a suspended
   member will receive the club newsletter and any relevant correspondence.

   Reasons for membership suspension or cancellation

     Piracy
     Copyright or patent infringement
     Abuse of club property, club members, or any BBS
     Theft
     Conduct deemed sufficiently inappropriate by the Board of Directors.

   A membership may be cancelled only by a majority vote at a Board of
   Directors meeting. The member is entitled to present a defense at this
   Board of Directors meeting and should be notified 30 days prior to said
   meeting.
