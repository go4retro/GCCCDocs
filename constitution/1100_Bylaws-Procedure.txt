Procedure

   Nominations shall take place each year in or about the month of September
   at a General Meeting. The voting shall take place the following month,
   unless voting was delayed until or after the November General Meeting.

   If there is only one candidate nominated for a position the candidate shall
   be declared elected by acclamation.

   All elections shall be conducted by secret ballot of the members in good
   standing present at the General Meeting of the GCCC. The individual acting
   as secretary for the meeting shall read off the names nominated for each
   position, and the vote taken.

   Ballots shall be counted by two members of the Board of Directors (not the
   Chair) present at the meeting. If there are not two Board of Directors
   members present, the Chair shall appoint impartial vote counters.

   In the event of a tie for first place between two or more candidates, a
   run-off ballot will be held between the tied candidates only. If the
   candidates remain tied after the second ballot then the election for that
   position will be postponed until the next General Meeting of the GCCC
   unless one candidate agrees to step down.

   For all elected positions only one officer shall be chosen.
