5. General Membership Meetings

5.1. General

   Meetings shall be held monthly on a date designated by the Board of
   Directors. Physical meetings should be held and shall be held at a
   location within the greater Chicago Metropolitan area as announced at a
   previous General Meeting and either in the newsletter or a special
   communication. Meetings should also support virtual participation.
   Meeting times may vary at the discretion of the President or Board of
   Directors.
   
   All meetings shall have a Chair to conduct the meeting. In order of
   priority, the Chair shall be:

     The President, the Vice President, or a member of the Board of Directors
     appointed by the President or a member of the Board of Directors if the
     President is not present.

   All meetings shall have minutes taken and passed to the Secretary. In
   order of priority, the minutes shall be taken by:

     The Secretary; or any regular member appointed by the Chair if the
     Secretary is not present.

   All meetings should be conducted in accordance with parliamentary
   procedure as interpreted by the Chair. Parliamentary procedure need not
   be followed rigorously; the intent is for club Meetings to be impartial
   and structured without getting bogged down in procedure. The Chair has
   final say in all decisions.

   Members may bring to club meetings friends and/or family members. However,
   young children must be supervised by the Member who brings them.

5.2. Responsibilities of the Chair

   Control of any meeting of the club rests with the Chair. The Chair should:

     Be familiar with the Constitution and Bylaws of the club, as well as
     the duties of the chair;

     Know, and follow, the order of business for the conduct of the meeting;

     Conduct the meeting in accordance with parliamentary procedure as
     described in Section 1 of Article IX;

     Ensure that each member has an opportunity to express his or her views
     but is not allowed to abuse this right.

   The Chair may delegate his or her authority when necessary.

5.3. Order of Business

     Meetings may be conducted in the following order:

       Call to order by the Chair once the presence of a quorum has been
       determined by the Chair. Failing the presence of a quorum, the fact
       shall be noted.

       Any reports from members of the executive.

       Any old business.

       Any new business.

       Adjournment.

       Demo(s).

     If a motion is presented which Members or the Chair feel requires study,
     the Chair may table the motion. A motion that remains tabled without
     discussion for more than six months is considered to have failed.

5.4. Making a Motion

     A motion is a proposal that the club take action, or that it express
     itself as holding certain opinions. A motion may be made by any regular
     Member of the club in good standing. Motions do not need to be delivered
     in writing except as specified in the Bylaws; however, it is suggested
     that motions of major importance be written for clarity and accuracy.

     A motion must be seconded before it may be considered.

     In most instances, a motion will be proposed, seconded, discussed, and
     voted on without any further complications. However this isn't always the
     case. The following actions may occur during discussion; if any occur,
     they must be voted on before a vote on the original motion may occur.

       An amendment to the original motion,

       A motion to table the original motion,

       A motion to refer the original motion for further study.

     No motion is in order that conflicts with the avowed object or purpose
     of the club, or concerns a subject over which the club has no
     jurisdiction.

     When a motion has been made, the Chair must consider it to determine
     whether it is in order.

5.5. Debating a Motion

     Unless ruled out of order by the Chair, a motion made and seconded is
     stated to the meeting and becomes a subject for discussion and decision.

     When moved, seconded and stated to the meeting, a motion cannot be
     withdrawn or ignored except as noted below. The motion can be resolved
     only in the following manner:

       The original mover asks for permission from the meeting members to
       have the motion withdrawn.

       No other member can ask to have a motion withdrawn; or

       The motion is tabled; or

       The motion is resolved by vote.

5.6. Voting

     A motion is decided by majority vote of Members present at the General
     Meeting, except as specified in Article 1, Section 3.

     Voting may be done by the use of ballots or a show of hands.

     Members cannot be compelled to vote on a motion, however, they should be
     encouraged to do so.

     The Chair of the meeting shall not normally vote, except in the event of a
     tie. This will help to preserve the impartiality of the Chair.

6. Board of Directors Meetings

6.1. General

     Meetings shall be held on an as-needed basis, but must be held at least
     quarterly. Meeting time and place shall be designated by the President.

     assembled.

     Board of Directors meetings shall be held informally, and need not
     follow strict parliamentary procedure.

     All meetings shall have minutes taken and passed to the Secretary, as
     specified in Article IX, Section 1.

     Only Board of Directors members may attend Board of Directors meetings,
     except as specified in the Bylaws, or by invitation of any Board of
     Directors member.

6.2. Special Board of Directors Meetings

     If the President deems immediate action necessary, a Special Board of
     Directors meeting may be called. If it is possible to resolve the issue
     at a regular Board of Directors meeting, a Special Board of Directors
     meeting is inappropriate.

     A Special Board of Directors Meeting may be conducted using:

       Telephone conference call; Electronic conference

       Decisions made at Special Board of Directors meetings are subject to
       review at following regular Board of Directors meetings.

       Minutes are not necessary, but a record of decisions made must be kept.

6.3. Voting

     A motion is decided by majority vote of Board of Directors members. All
     Board of Directors members get one vote.

     The President may cast a tie-breaking vote when necessary.

     If the President is not present and there is a tie, the Vice President
     may cast a tie-breaking vote.

     distributing copyrighted material illegally, that system shall be dropped
     as a Glenside BBS.

   The club may provide cash support to the system operators of official
   Glenside BBSs or Web Sites. The amount cannot exceed $50.00 per year per
   system operator.
