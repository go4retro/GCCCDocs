Section 4
   Any motion to amend the Constitution shall be dealt with at the General Meeting 
   of the GCCC following delivery of the periodical in which the motion to amend is 
   published. At such meeting, the motion may be passed as delivered, amended, or 
   tabled.

Section 5
   A tabled motion to amend the Constitution may be dealt with at any future

   consideration of any amendment to the motion. Any motion which has been tabled 
   for more than six months without discussion shall be considered to have failed.

   The Bylaws passed pursuant to this Constitution may be amended by a simple 
   majority vote of the quorum at a General Meeting and no notice need be given of

   delivered in writing. 

Section 2
   As with the Constitution, a motion to amend the bylaws may be tabled for up to

Article V - Membership
Section 1 – Categories of Membership

   The membership of the GCCC shall consist of the following categories: 

     General Membership

     Contributing Membership
		
     Honorary Membership

   General Membership is open to anyone in the Community.

   A Contributing Member shall be deemed to be in good standing upon payment of 
   the annual membership dues of the GCCC.  Contributing Members in good standing
   are entitled to one vote at General Meetings of the GCCC, and are entitled to
   one copy of each issue of the periodical published while the Member is in good
   standing.  Membership is renewed annually, and lasts through the end of the 
   calendar year. 

   The Board of Directors may nominate as Honorary Members individuals deemed by 
   the Board to be worthy.  An Honorary Membership shall be ratified by a simple 
   majority of the quorum at any General Meeting.  Honorary Members have all 
   rights and privileges of Contributing Members in good standing but are not 
   expected to pay dues.  An Honorary Membership term is for the lifetime of the
   GCCC, unless dismissed as discussed below.
 
Section 2 – Conduct of Members

	In rare instances it might be necessary for the Board of Directors to consider
  disciplinary action against a member.  Causes for such consideration would be:

	  Software piracy

	  Copyright or patent infringement

	  Abuse of club property, club members, or any BBS
    
	  Theft

	  Conduct deemed sufficiently inappropriate by the Board of Directors

  The responses available to the BOD include membership suspension or 
  cancellation.  A member whose membership is suspended is still a member of the
  GCCC, but for a period of time as determined by the Board of Directors is 
  deemed to be not in good standing and may not attend any GCCC functions.  
  However, such a member will still receive the club newsletter and relevant 
  correspondence.  A member whose membership is cancelled cannot again become a
  member of the GCCC, and may not attend any GCCC functions.  A membership may
  be cancelled only by a majority vote at a Board of Directors meeting.  The 
  member is entitled to present a defense at this meeting and should be notified
  30 days prior to said meeting.

Section 3 - Membership Dues

   Each Contributing Member shall pay annual dues in the amount set by the Board 
   of Directors and published in the Bylaws. Dues are non-refundable, but may be
   pro-rated monthly for Contributing Members joining partway through a calendar 
   year. 

   The initial dues shall be as follows: $15.00 US per calendar year.  
   Membership dues for subsequent years can be changed at any meeting of the BOD
   with a majority vote, but the change must be noted in the club newsletter or a
   special mailing distributed at least one month prior to the coming year. The 
   BOD may at its discretion state that paid attendance at an annual CoCoFEST 
   constitutes payment of dues for that year. Renewal dues will be considered to
   be in arrears if not paid by the end of the annual CoCoFEST. Any Contributing
   Member who fails to timely pay renewal dues to the GCCC shall be deemed to be 
   not in good standing and to have his Contributing Membership lapsed and 
   privileges revoked until such time as the dues are paid.

Article VI - General Membership Meetings
Section 1 – Date, time, location

	General meetings shall be held monthly, on the third Thursday of each month, 
  except as designated by the Board of Directors.  Meetings shall be held at the
  residence of Brian Schubring, 2131 Mallard Lane, Hanover Park, IL 60103 unless
  otherwise announced at a previous general meeting and/or in the newsletter or 
  special mailing.  Provision shall be made for remote members to participate in
  the meetings by means of internet videoconferencing, and members attending in
  this fashion shall have the same rights as those attending in person.
  Meetings normally start at 7:30 PM Central time and end by 10:00 PM, but 
  meeting times may vary at the discretion of the President or Board of 
  Directors.

Section 2 – Conduct of General Meetings

	All meetings shall have a Chair to conduct the meeting.  In order of priority,
  the Chair shall be:  the President, or the Vice President, or another member 
  of the Board of Directors designated by the President, or a BOD member chosen
  by the BOD if the President is absent without designating a substitute.  The 
  Chair may delegate his authority when necessary.  Control of the meeting rests
  with the Chair.  The Chair should:

	  be familiar with the Constitution and Bylaws of the GCCC, as well as the 
    duties of his/position;

	  know, and follow, the order of business for the conduct of the meeting;

	  conduct the meeting in accordance with accepted parliamentary procedure;

	  ensure that each member present has an opportunity to express his views but 
    is not allowed to abuse that right.

	All meetings shall have minutes taken by the Secretary if he is present.  
  Otherwise, the Chair shall appoint an attending Contributing Member as a 
  substitute for the task.  Within a reasonable time after the meeting this
  member shall forward his minutes to the Secretary for distribution and 
  archiving.

 	All meetings should be conducted in accordance with parliamentary procedure as
  interpreted by the Chair. Parliamentary procedure need not be followed 
  rigorously; the intent is for GCCC Meetings to be impartial and structured 
  without getting bogged down in procedure. The Chair has final say in all 
  decisions.
 
	Members may bring to GCCC Meetings friends and/or family members. However, 
  young children must be supervised by the Member who brings them. 

	Meetings may be conducted in the following order:

    Call to order by the Chair once the presence of a quorum has been determined
    by the Chair.  Failing the presence of a quorum, that fact shall be noted in
    the minutes.

		Secretary’s report:  verification and approval (with corrections if needed)
    of the minutes of the previous meeting

		Treasurer’s report:  financial summary covering the immediately prior 
    calendar month

		Optional reports from other appointed Directors or ad-hoc committees

		Old Business (tabled motions, or topics awaiting further discussion)

		New Business

		Adjournment

		Optional demos

Section 3 – Actions Taken at General Meetings

	A motion is a proposal that the GCCC take action, or that it express itself as
  holding certain opinions.  A motion may be made by any Contributing Member of 
  the GCCC in good standing.  Motions do not need to be delivered in writing
  except as specified in the Bylaws; however, it is suggested that motions of 
  major importance be written for clarity and accuracy.  When a motion has been 
  made, the Chair must first consider it to determine whether it is in order.  
  (No motion is in order which conflicts with the avowed object or purpose of 
  the GCCC, or concerns a subject over which the GCCC has no jurisdiction.)  
  Then a motion must be seconded before it may be considered.
	
	Unless ruled out of order by the Chair, a motion made and seconded should be 
  restated to the meeting and becomes a subject for discussion and decision.  In
  most instances, a motion will be discussed and voted on without any further 
  complications.  However, this is not always the case.  The following actions
  may occur during discussion; if any occur, they must be voted on before a vote
  on the original motion may occur:

	  An amendment to the original motion is proposed, or

	  a motion is made to table the original motion, or

	  a motion is made to refer the original motion for further study, or

	  the original mover asks for permission to withdraw the motion (no other 
    member can make this request).

	Additionally, if a motion is presented which members or the Chair feel 
  requires further study or discussion, the Chair may use his authority to table
  the motion without a vote.  Once a motion is tabled or referred for further 
  study, discussion of it is ended for the duration of that  meeting.  A motion 
  that remains tabled without action for more than six months is considered to 
  have failed.

	A motion is decided by majority vote of the Contributing Members present at 
  the meeting.  Voting may be done verbally, by a show of hands, or via specific
  internet software.  Members cannot be compelled to vote on a motion; however, 
  they should be encouraged to do so.  The Chair of the meeting shall not 
  normally vote except in the event of a tie.  This will help to preserve the 
  impartiality of the Chair.

Article VII – Meetings of the Board of Directors
Section 1 – Date, Time, Location

	Meetings shall be held on an as-needed basis, but must be held at least 
  semiannually.  Meeting dates, times, and locations are designated by the 
  president.

Section 2 – Conduct of BOD Meetings

	The President shall chair meetings if he is present, otherwise the 
  Vice-President takes that role.

	No actions may be taken by the Board of Directors unless a quorum is present.
	A motion is decided by majority vote of BOD members.  BOD members not present 
  may cast their votes by proxy.  The Chair should refrain from voting except in
  case of a tie.

	All meetings shall have minutes taken by the Secretary or a designated 
  substitute.

	Only BOD members may attend BOD meetings unless by invitation of a BOD member.
	BOD meetings shall be held informally, and need not follow strict 
  parliamentary procedures.

Section 3 – Special Board of Directors Meetings

	If the President deems immediate action to be necessary he may call a Special 
  BOD Meeting.  If it is possible to resolve the issue at a regular BOD meeting,
  a special meeting is not appropriate.

	A Special BOD Meeting may be conducted using a telephone conference call or an
  electronic or internet conference system.

	Minutes of a Special BOD Meeting are not required, but a record of decisions 
  must be kept.

	Decisions made at a Special BOD Meeting are subject to review at subsequent 
  Regular BOD Meetings.

Section 4 – Responsibilities and Powers of the Board of Directors

	The Purpose of the BOD shall be to oversee the general operations of the GCCC,
  and to set policy. 

	The BOD shall review all appointed Directorships annually and at other times 
  as it may see fit, and, if necessary, reassign such positions by vote.  The 
  President may nominate Members for appointed positions; these nominations must
  be approved by a majority vote at a BOD Meeting.

	The BOD shall authorize all expenditures by the GCCC except as otherwise noted
  in the Constitution or Bylaws.
 
	The BOD may, at its discretion, support financially or by other means, the 
  activities of other groups which promote personal computers in accordance with
  the stated purpose of the GCCC. 

	The BOD may contract for the use of facilities and services as it sees fit to 
  further the stated purposes of the GCCC.
 
	BOD decisions are made by majority vote at a BOD Meeting. The Chair may, if 
  necessary, cast a tie-breaking vote.
 
	If a club elected officer or appointed Director is clearly shown to be 
  unwilling, unable, or incapable of performing the duties of the office, the 
  BOD may tell that person to step down.

	If an elected President is asked to step down, the Vice President shall assume
  the President’s post until the next regular election, or the BOD may instead 
  designate another substitute for that period of time. 
	If an elected officer other than the President is unable to complete his term,
  a replacement shall be chosen by the BOD.  This appointment will last until
  the next regular election.

Article VIII - The Elected officers

	At the meeting, nominations should be entertained by the Chair from 
  Contributing Members in the following order: President, Vice-President, 
  Treasurer, Secretary.  As each nomination is made the chair should first 
  confirm whether the nominee is willing to accept the duty, then ask for a 
  second from a Contributing Member.  A second is required to make a nomination 
  valid.  Before closing nominations for each office, the Chair shall inquire 
  whether there are any further nominations.  If there is no response, 
  nominations for that office are closed.

  Written nominations may also be submitted to the Secretary prior to the 
  September meeting.  Such nominations must be signed by two Contributing 
  Members in good standing, and also by the candidate if he will not be present 
  at the meeting.

	Promptly after the meeting, the list of nominees shall be posted both on the 
  club web site and on the TandyList site, and made available to any member who 
  requests the information.

	Every GCCC Contributing Member in good standing is entitled to one vote for 
  each elective office.  Voting is done by means of special software at the 
  TandyList site which preserves the voter’s privacy, while checking that he is 
  current with his dues.  Deadline for voting is the beginning of the October 
  General Meeting, at which time the results are downloaded and the new officers
  ratified as part of the meeting proceedings.  For each elective position only
  one officer shall be chosen.  In the event of a tie, a run-off ballot will be
  held between the tied candidates.  Normally, the new officers begin their
  terms with the November General Meeting.
