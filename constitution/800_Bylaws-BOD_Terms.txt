Terms, Duties and Responsibilities of the Board of Directors:

   The Purpose of the Board of Directors shall be to oversee the general
   operations of the GCCC, and to set policy. The officers are responsible
   for day-to-day operations, not the Board of Directors.

   The Board of Directors shall review all appointed positions annually and at
   other times as it may see fit, and, if necessary, reassign such position by
   vote. The President may nominate Members for appointed positions; these
   nominations must be approved by a majority vote at a Board of Directors
   meeting.

   The Board of Directors shall authorize all expenditures by the GCCC except
   as otherwise noted in the Constitution or Bylaws.

   The Board of Directors may, at its discretion, support financially or by
   other means, the activities of other groups that promote personal computers
   in accordance with the stated purpose of the GCCC.

   The Board of Directors may contract for the use of facilities and services
   as it sees fit to further the stated purposes of the GCCC.

   Board of Directors decisions are made by majority vote at a Board of
   Directors meeting. The Chair may, if necessary, cast a tie-breaking vote.

   If a club officer is clearly shown to be unwilling, unable, or incapable
   of performing the duties of the office, the Board of Directors may tell
   that officer to step down.

   If an elected officer other than the President is unable to complete the
   term, a replacement shall be chosen by the Board of Directors. This
   appointment will last until the next General Election.
