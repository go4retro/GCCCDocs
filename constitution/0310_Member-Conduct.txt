Section 2 – Conduct of Members

   In rare instances it might be necessary for the Board of Directors to consider
   disciplinary action against a member.  Causes for such consideration would be:

     Software piracy

     Copyright or patent infringement

     Abuse of club property, club members, or any BBS
    
     Theft

     Conduct deemed sufficiently inappropriate by the Board of Directors

   The responses available to the BOD include membership suspension or 
   cancellation.  A member whose membership is suspended is still a member of the
   GCCC, but for a period of time as determined by the Board of Directors is 
   deemed to be not in good standing and may not attend any GCCC functions.  
   However, such a member will still receive the club newsletter and relevant 
   correspondence.  A member whose membership is cancelled cannot again become a
   member of the GCCC, and may not attend any GCCC functions.  A membership may
   be cancelled only by a majority vote at a Board of Directors meeting.  The 
   member is entitled to present a defense at this meeting and should be notified
   30 days prior to said meeting.
