Nominations:

   The date and location of the General Meeting of the GCCC at which the
   election will be held will be published in the periodical at least one
   month in advance.

   Nominations shall be for only the President, Vice President, Secretary and
   Treasurer in that order.

   Oral nominations are to be made from the floor. A seconder is required.
   Before closing nominations, the Chair shall inquire if there are any
   further nominations, and if there is no response, the nominations are closed. The
   candidate must be present and agree with the nomination either at the
   meeting of nomination or at the meeting where elections take place. If the
   candidate is not present at either meeting, he or she may only be nominated
   using a written nomination.

   Written nominations may be submitted in writing to the secretary prior to
   the Meeting. Such nominations must be signed by two nominators in good
   standing, and the candidate if the candidate is not present at the Meeting.
