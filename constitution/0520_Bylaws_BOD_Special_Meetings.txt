Section 3 – Special Board of Directors Meetings

	If the President deems immediate action to be necessary he may call a Special 
  BOD Meeting.  If it is possible to resolve the issue at a regular BOD meeting,
  a special meeting is not appropriate.

	A Special BOD Meeting may be conducted using a telephone conference call or an
  electronic or internet conference system.

	Minutes of a Special BOD Meeting are not required, but a record of decisions 
  must be kept.

	Decisions made at a Special BOD Meeting are subject to review at subsequent 
  Regular BOD Meetings.
