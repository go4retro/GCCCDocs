Section 4 – Responsibilities and Powers of the Board of Directors

   The Purpose of the BOD shall be to oversee the general operations of the GCCC,
   and to set policy. 

   The BOD shall review all appointed Directorships annually and at other times 
   as it may see fit, and, if necessary, reassign such positions by vote.  The 
   President may nominate Members for appointed positions; these nominations must
   be approved by a majority vote at a BOD Meeting.

   The BOD shall authorize all expenditures by the GCCC except as otherwise noted
   in the Constitution or Bylaws.
 
   The BOD may, at its discretion, support financially or by other means, the 
   activities of other groups which promote personal computers in accordance with
   the stated purpose of the GCCC. 

   The BOD may contract for the use of facilities and services as it sees fit to 
   further the stated purposes of the GCCC.
 
   BOD decisions are made by majority vote at a BOD Meeting. The Chair may, if 
   necessary, cast a tie-breaking vote.
 
   If a club elected officer or appointed Director is clearly shown to be 
   unwilling, unable, or incapable of performing the duties of the office, the 
   BOD may tell that person to step down.

   If an elected President is asked to step down, the Vice President shall assume
   the President’s post until the next regular election, or the BOD may instead 
   designate another substitute for that period of time. 

   If an elected officer other than the President is unable to complete his term,
   a replacement shall be chosen by the BOD.  This appointment will last until
   the next regular election.
