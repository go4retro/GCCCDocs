Section 4 – Duties of the Director of Communications 

   The Director of Communications shall maintain an official Glenside BBS. 

   The Director of Communications shall maintain a list of known BBSs supporting 
   the CoCo.

   Other “official” Glenside BBS's may be established by members of the GCCC 
   providing the following rules are met: 

   The BBS must be approved by the BOD. 

   The name of the BBS must include the word Glenside on the log-in screen. 
   Meeting announcements and other GCCC activities must be posted for all	
   callers to read after establishing their accounts and passwords. 

   At no time will the BBS or its operator knowingly distribute copyrighted
   software without permission of the copyright holder. If it is found that an 
   official BBS is knowingly providing or distributing copyrighted material 
   illegally, that system shall be dropped as an official Glenside BBS. If this
   system is run by the Director of Communications, then he will be told to 
   step down from that position by the BOD and a new Member will be found to 
   fill the position. 

   GCCC Members may not be charged for access to the BBS, Glenside bulletins, 
   internal mail, or internal databases, but may be charged for special 
   services such as Internet mail or USENet news. 

   The GCCC may provide cash support to the system operators of official
   Glenside BBS's.   The amount cannot exceed $50.00 per year per system 
   operator. 

   Each system operator must police his or her BBS, including defining a code
   of conduct.
