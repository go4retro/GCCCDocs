Section 2 – Conduct of BOD Meetings

   The President shall chair meetings if he is present, otherwise the 
   Vice-President takes that role.

   No actions may be taken by the Board of Directors unless a quorum is present.
   A motion is decided by majority vote of BOD members.  BOD members not present 
   may cast their votes by proxy.  The Chair should refrain from voting except in
   case of a tie.

   All meetings shall have minutes taken by the Secretary or a designated 
   substitute.

   Only BOD members may attend BOD meetings unless by invitation of a BOD member.
   BOD meetings shall be held informally, and need not follow strict 
   parliamentary procedures.
