Section 3 - Membership Dues

   Each Contributing Member shall pay annual dues in the amount set by the Board 
   of Directors and published in the Bylaws. Dues are non-refundable, but may be
   pro-rated monthly for Contributing Members joining partway through a calendar 
   year. 

   The initial dues shall be as follows: $15.00 US per calendar year.  
   Membership dues for subsequent years can be changed at any meeting of the BOD
   with a majority vote, but the change must be noted in the club newsletter or a
   special mailing distributed at least one month prior to the coming year. The 
   BOD may at its discretion state that paid attendance at an annual CoCoFEST 
   constitutes payment of dues for that year. Renewal dues will be considered to
   be in arrears if not paid by the end of the annual CoCoFEST. Any Contributing
   Member who fails to timely pay renewal dues to the GCCC shall be deemed to be 
   not in good standing and to have his Contributing Membership lapsed and 
   privileges revoked until such time as the dues are paid.
