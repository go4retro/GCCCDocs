Article V - Membership
Section 1 – Categories of Membership

   The membership of the GCCC shall consist of the following categories: 

     General Membership

     Contributing Membership
		
     Honorary Membership

   General Membership is open to anyone in the Community.

   A Contributing Member shall be deemed to be in good standing upon payment of 
   the annual membership dues of the GCCC.  Contributing Members in good standing
   are entitled to one vote at General Meetings of the GCCC, and are entitled to
   one copy of each issue of the periodical published while the Member is in good
   standing.  Membership is renewed annually, and lasts through the end of the 
   calendar year. 

   The Board of Directors may nominate as Honorary Members individuals deemed by 
   the Board to be worthy.  An Honorary Membership shall be ratified by a simple 
   majority of the quorum at any General Meeting.  Honorary Members have all 
   rights and privileges of Contributing Members in good standing but are not 
   expected to pay dues.  An Honorary Membership term is for the lifetime of the
   GCCC, unless dismissed as discussed below.
