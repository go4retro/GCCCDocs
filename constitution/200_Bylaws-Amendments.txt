               Amendments to the Constitution and Bylaws

   Any individual Board of Directors member in good standing may, at any time, move
   to amend the Constitution by delivering a written "motion to amend" to the 
   Secretary.

   A motion to amend the Constitution shall be signed by the member making the 
   motion and by at least two seconders, both of whom shall be Contributing Members 
   of the GCCC in good standing.

   Upon receipt of a motion to amend the Constitution, the Secretary shall cause to 
   be published in the Newsletter a copy of the motion, and cause a copy of the 
   motion to be delivered to each member of the Board of Directors.

   Any motion to amend the Constitution shall be dealt with at the General Meeting 
   of the GCCC following delivery of the periodical in which the motion to amend is 
   published. At such meeting, the motion may be passed as delivered, amended, or 
   tabled. No further notice need be given before the consideration of any 
   amendment to the motion.

   A tabled motion to amend the Constitution may be dealt with at any future 
   General Meeting. No further notice need be given before such additional 
   consideration of any amendment to the motion. Any motion that has been tabled 
   for more than six months without discussion shall be considered to have failed.

   No amendment to the Constitution shall be effective unless it is passed by a 
   two-thirds majority vote of the quorum at a General Meeting of the GCCC. 

   The Bylaws passed pursuant to this Constitution may be amended by a simple 
   majority vote of the quorum at a General Meeting and no notice need be given of 
   a motion to amend the Bylaws; however, a motion to amend the Bylaws must be 
   delivered in writing. 

   As with the Constitution, a motion to amend the bylaws may be tabled for up to 
   six months. A motion that is tabled for more than six months without discussion 
   is considered to have failed.
